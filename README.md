# Dracona Delights — Static Site
This is a drag‑and‑drop static website for Dragonfruit Powder.

## Quick Deploy (fastest)
1) Go to **https://app.netlify.com/drop**.
2) Drag the entire folder you unzipped into the page.
3) Wait ~10–20 seconds — you'll get a public URL like `https://something.netlify.app`.

## Vercel (optional)
1) Create a new project and **Import** this folder from your computer or a Git repo.
2) Framework: **Other** (no build step). Output: `/`.
3) Deploy.

## Edit Content
- Replace the placeholders with your own product photos in `index.html` (search for "Replace with your product photo").
